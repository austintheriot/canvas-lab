# Canvas Lab

Welcome to my Canvas Lab repo! This repository is my personal space for TypeScript and HTML canvas experiments. I'm interested in creating interactive visual experiments, data structure/algorithm visualizations, and generative art projects. 

This repository is under development, so expect lots of changes and not a lot of buttoned-up code. But do feel free to look around!
